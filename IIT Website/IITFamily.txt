<h2>Demonstrating a few HTML features</h2>
HTML is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text,</br>
 with commands that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters, or </br>
between an "&" and a ";". </br>

You don't really need to know much HTML to create a page, because</br>
 you can copy bits of HTML from other pages that do what you want,</br>
 then change the text!</br></br>

This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the</br>
 corresponding HTML code appears on the right. The HTML</br>
 commands are linked to explanations of what they do.</br></br>
